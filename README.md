# School Notes ðŸ“š  

Welcome to my collection of school notes! This repository serves as a growing archive of my class materials and a hands-on project to improve my LaTeX skills.  

## Why This Exists  
- **Organization**: A semi-structured attempt to keep my notes in one place.  
- **Learning LaTeX**: I'm using this project as a way to learn and practice LaTeX for creating well-formatted documents.  

## What You'll Find  
- Subject-specific notes (organized by topic or class).  
- Examples of LaTeX formatting and templates Iâ€™ve explored.  
- A bit of chaosâ€”itâ€™s still a work in progress!  

## How to Use  
- Browse through the folders for notes on specific subjects.  
- If you're new to LaTeX, you might find some useful templates or formatting tips here.  
- Feel free to contribute ideas or improvements!  

## Future Plans  
- Streamline folder organization.  
- Add more advanced LaTeX features like tables, equations, and diagrams.  
- Create a consistent template for all notes.

Thanks for checking out my notes! Letâ€™s keep learning. ðŸš€
