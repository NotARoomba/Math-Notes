\section{Waves}
Waves are a way to represent the movement of energy through a medium. They have a frequency and a wavelength. The frequency is the number of cycles per second and the wavelength is the distance between two peaks or valleys. The velocity of a wave is the product of the frequency and the wavelength.
\subsection{Symbols}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(v\) is the velocity of the wave (\(\frac{m}{s}\))
    \item \(f\) is the frequency of the wave in Hertz (\(\frac{1}{s}\) $\lor$ \(s^{-1}\))
    \item \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the wave (\(m\))
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Formulas}
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        v & = f * \lambda \\
        f & = \frac{v}{\lambda} \\
        \lambda & = \frac{v}{f}
    \end{aligned}
\]

\begin{waveexamples}
    Calculate the period of a wave whos frequency is 440Hz.
\[ 
    \begin{aligned}
        f & = \frac{1}{T} \\
        440 & = \frac{1}{T} \\
        T & = \frac{1}{440} \\
        T & = 2.2\overline{7} = 0.00227s
    \end{aligned}

   A meteriological station informs that the waves along the coast have a separation of \(8s\). Calculate the frequency of the waves.
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        f & = \frac{1}{T} \\
        f & = \frac{1}{8} \\
        f & = 0.125Hz

A mosquit emits a sound when it beats its wings 600 times per second.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item What is the frequency of the waves produced? \[600Hz\]
    \item What is the wavelength of the waves produced by the mosquito given that the speed of sound is 340m/s? \[\begin{aligned}\lambda & = \frac{v}{f} \\\lambda & = \frac{340\, m/s}{600\, s^{-1}}\\\lambda & = 0.5666\overline{6}m\end{aligned}\]
